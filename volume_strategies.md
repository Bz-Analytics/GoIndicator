#### Money Flow Index Strategy

The [MoneyFlowIndexStrategy](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/cinar/indicator#MoneyFlowIndexStrategy) uses the _mfi_ values that are generated by the [Money Flow Index (MFI)](volume_indicators.md#money-flow-index-mfi) indicator function to provide a _SELL_ action when _mfi_ is greather than or equal to 80, and a _BUY_ action when _mfi_ is less than or equal to 20.

```Golang
actions := MoneyFlowIndexStrategy(asset)
```
